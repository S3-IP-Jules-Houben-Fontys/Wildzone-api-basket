# Wildzone-api-basket

The basket API ensures that Wildzone customers' shopping cart is kept up to date. So, as soon as a Wildzone customer adds an item in the front-end, it is passed on to the Wildzone-api-basket to be processed and stored. In this API, no rows are deleted, just archived. In this way the data is preserved, but the Wildzone customer in principle does not notice anything. The Wildzone-api-basket is a microservice of the (demo) Wildzone webshop & admin panel. For detailed info regarding choices in this project, reference is made to the <a href="https://github.com/S3-IP-Jules-Houben-Fontys/Wildzone-documentation">Wildzone documentation (in Dutch)</a>
